## System Flow

### Request Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant RE as Reasoning Engine
    participant M as Memory
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant R as RBAC
    participant A as Agents
    
    U->>RE: Submit Request
    RE->>M: Store Request
    RE->>RE: Analyze Intent
    RE->>O: Create Workflow
    O->>R: Check Permissions
    R-->>O: Permission Status
    
    alt Permissions Granted
        O->>A: Execute Workflow
        A-->>O: Execution Results
        O->>RE: Process Results
        RE->>M: Update Memory
        RE->>U: Return Response
    else Permissions Denied
        R-->>O: Access Denied
        O->>RE: Error Status
        RE->>U: Permission Error
    end
```

## User Interaction Example

### 1. Initial Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as System
    
    U->>S: I need to track champions in my database when they change companies
    Note over S: Reasoning Engine:<br>- Analyzes intent<br>- Plans workflow<br>- Checks context
    S->>U: Let me help you set that up. Which data source contains your champion information?
    Note over S: Memory Store:<br>- Saves conversation<br>- Maintains context
    U->>S: Salesforce CRM
    Note over S: RBAC Layer:<br>- Validates permissions<br>- Checks access rights
```

### 2. Configuration Phase

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as System
    
    Note over S: Orchestrator:<br>- Manages workflow<br>- Coordinates agents
    S->>U: Would you like to enable cross-source validation for higher accuracy?
    U->>S: Yes
    S->>U: How frequently should we check for updates?
    U->>S: Daily
    S->>U: Where should we send notifications about changes?
    U->>S: Slack
```

**Backend Execution:**
- Reasoning Engine processes natural language input
- Breaks down request into actionable components
- Begins forming execution plan
- No external service calls yet

### 3. Execution Phase

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as System
    participant DA as Data Agent
    participant VA as Validation Agent
    participant UA as Update Agent
    participant NA as Notification Agent
    
    Note over S: Orchestrator initiates workflow
    
    S->>DA: Start data collection
    Note over DA: Checks conditions:<br>- Active contacts<br>- Recent activity<br>- Profile completeness
    DA-->>S: Found 50 champions
    
    S->>VA: Validate changes
    Note over VA: Analyzes changes:<br>- 5 company changes<br>- 3 high confidence<br>- 2 pending verification
    VA-->>S: Validation complete
    
    S->>UA: Process updates
    Note over UA: Updates records:<br>- 5 champion updates<br>- 2 new companies<br>- 3 relationship changes
    UA-->>S: Updates complete
    
    S->>NA: Send notifications
    Note over NA: Distributes alerts:<br>- Team updates<br>- Admin alerts<br>- Sales notifications
    NA-->>S: Notifications sent
```

**Backend Execution:**
- Reasoning Engine finalizes workflow plan
- Prepares to hand off to Orchestrator
- Creates execution sequence
- Defines required permissions

### 4. Orchestrator Execution
```
Orchestrator: [Executes workflow steps]
1. Sets up triggers
2. Pulls Salesforce data
3. Checks champion status
4. Updates records
5. Sends alerts
```

**Backend Execution and User Interaction:**

1. **Initial RBAC Validation:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Orchestrator->>RBAC: Validate All Required Permissions
   RBAC-->>Orchestrator: Permission Status for All Operations
   Orchestrator->>User: Display Permission Status
   ```

2. **Data Retrieval Phase:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Data Agent->>External Services: Query Data Sources
   External Services-->>Data Agent: Return Data
   Data Agent->>User: "I found 50 champions in the system. Here's what I discovered..."
   ```

3. **Validation Phase:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Validation Agent->>External Services: Verify Changes
   External Services-->>Validation Agent: Return Status
   Validation Agent->>User: "I detected 5 company changes. Here are the details..."
   ```

4. **Update Phase:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Update Agent->>External Services: Update Records
   External Services-->>Update Agent: Confirm Updates
   Update Agent->>User: "I've updated the records. Here's what changed..."
   ```

5. **Notification Phase:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Notification Agent->>External Services: Send Alerts
   External Services-->>Notification Agent: Confirm Delivery
   Notification Agent->>User: "I've sent notifications to relevant stakeholders..."
   ```

## Security and Permissions

The system performs comprehensive RBAC validation upfront:

1. **Pre-execution Permission Check:**
   ```
   Reasoning Engine: "Before we proceed, let me verify all required permissions..."
   
   Checking permissions for:
   - Data source access
   - Record modification rights
   - Notification capabilities
   - External service access
   
   "All permissions verified. Here's what we can do..."
   ```

2. **Permission Summary:**
   The system provides a clear overview of:
   - Available operations based on permissions
   - Any restricted actions
   - Alternative approaches if needed

3. **Transparent Operation Flow:**
   After permission verification:
   - Each agent operates with pre-validated access
   - Continuous feedback to user about progress
   - Clear communication of results
   - No workflow disruption for permission checks

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling at multiple levels:

1. **Reasoning Engine Level:**
   - Invalid input detection
   - Workflow validation
   - Plan verification

2. **Orchestrator Level:**
   - Step execution monitoring
   - Resource availability checks
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Agent Level:**
   - Operation-specific validation
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Fallback procedures

4. **External Service Level:**
   - Connection error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Failure notifications

## Monitoring and Logging

The system maintains comprehensive logs for:

1. **Workflow Execution:**
   - Step completion status
   - Timing information
   - Resource utilization

2. **Security Events:**
   - Permission checks
   - Access attempts
   - Authentication events

3. **Data Operations:**
   - Record updates
   - Validation results
   - Error occurrences

4. **System Health:**
   - Component status
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource utilization

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of how the Champion Tracking System processes requests, from initial user interaction through complete workflow execution, highlighting the role of each component and the security measures in place.
