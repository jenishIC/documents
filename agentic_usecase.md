# Champion Tracking System: Conversation Flow and Backend Execution

This document explains how the Champion Tracking System processes user requests through its multi-agent architecture, demonstrating both the conversational flow and the underlying technical execution.

## Conversation Flow Example

### 1. User Initiation
```
User: "I need to track champions in my Salesforce database. Specifically, I want to monitor when they change companies, update their records, and handle associated account information automatically."
```

**Backend Execution:**
- Request received by Reasoning Engine
- Initial intent parsing begins
- No RBAC check needed at this stage as it's just intent gathering

### 2. Reasoning Engine Interaction
```
Reasoning Engine: [Confirms problem definition and requirements]
- Monitors champions in Salesforce
- Identifies company changes
- Updates records accordingly
```

**Backend Execution:**
- Reasoning Engine processes natural language input
- Breaks down request into actionable components
- Begins forming execution plan
- No external service calls yet

### 3. Workflow Planning
```
Reasoning Engine: [Creates detailed workflow plan]
- Trigger setup (daily)
- Data pull configuration
- Status check planning
- Record update strategy
- Alert system integration
```

**Backend Execution:**
- Reasoning Engine finalizes workflow plan
- Prepares to hand off to Orchestrator
- Creates execution sequence
- Defines required permissions

### 4. Orchestrator Execution
```
Orchestrator: [Executes workflow steps]
1. Sets up triggers
2. Pulls Salesforce data
3. Checks champion status
4. Updates records
5. Sends alerts
```

**Backend Execution:**
Detailed sequence with RBAC checks at each step:

1. **Data Retrieval Phase:**

   Data Agent->>External Services: Query Salesforce
   External Services-->>Data Agent: Return Data
   ```

2. **Validation Phase:**

   Orchestrator->>RBAC: Validate Permissions
   RBAC-->>Validation Agent: Grant Access
   Validation Agent->>External Services: Verify Changes
   External Services-->>Validation Agent: Return Status
   ```

3. **Update Phase:**
   ```mermaid

   Orchestrator->>RBAC: Validate Permissions
   RBAC-->>Update Agent: Grant Access
   Update Agent->>External Services: Update Records
   External Services-->>Update Agent: Confirm Updates
   ```

4. **Notification Phase:**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   Orchestrator->>RBAC: Validate Permissions
   RBAC-->>Notification Agent: Grant Access
   Notification Agent->>External Services: Send Alerts
   External Services-->>Notification Agent: Confirm Delivery
   ```

## Key Components and Their Roles

### 1. Reasoning Engine (RE)
- Processes natural language input
- Plans workflow execution
- Coordinates with Orchestrator
- Provides user feedback

### 2. Orchestrator (O)
- Manages workflow execution
- Coordinates between agents
- Ensures RBAC compliance
- Handles error scenarios

### 3. RBAC Service
- Validates permissions at each step
- Ensures security compliance
- Controls access to resources
- Maintains audit trail

### 4. Specialized Agents

#### Data Agent (DA)
- Handles data retrieval
- Processes Salesforce queries
- Manages data transformations
- Ensures data integrity

#### Validation Agent (VA)
- Verifies company changes
- Validates data consistency
- Checks business rules
- Reports validation results

#### Update Agent (UA)
- Manages record updates
- Creates new accounts
- Updates existing records
- Maintains data relationships

#### Notification Agent (NA)
- Handles alert distribution
- Manages notification preferences
- Ensures delivery confirmation
- Handles notification failures

### 5. External Services
- Salesforce integration
- oGraph status checks
- Email/notification systems
- Additional third-party services

## Security and Permissions

Every operation in the system goes through RBAC validation:

1. **Initial Request:**
   - Validates user permissions
   - Checks access levels
   - Verifies resource availability

2. **Data Operations:**
   - Validates read/write permissions
   - Ensures data access compliance
   - Maintains audit logs

3. **External Service Calls:**
   - Validates API permissions
   - Ensures secure connections
   - Manages authentication

4. **Notifications:**
   - Validates notification permissions
   - Ensures data privacy
   - Controls information distribution

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling at multiple levels:

1. **Reasoning Engine Level:**
   - Invalid input detection
   - Workflow validation
   - Plan verification

2. **Orchestrator Level:**
   - Step execution monitoring
   - Resource availability checks
   - Recovery procedures

3. **Agent Level:**
   - Operation-specific validation
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Fallback procedures

4. **External Service Level:**
   - Connection error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Failure notifications

## Monitoring and Logging

The system maintains comprehensive logs for:

1. **Workflow Execution:**
   - Step completion status
   - Timing information
   - Resource utilization

2. **Security Events:**
   - Permission checks
   - Access attempts
   - Authentication events

3. **Data Operations:**
   - Record updates
   - Validation results
   - Error occurrences

4. **System Health:**
   - Component status
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource utilization

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of how the Champion Tracking System processes requests, from initial user interaction through complete workflow execution, highlighting the role of each component and the security measures in place.
